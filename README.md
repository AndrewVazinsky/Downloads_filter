# Downloads_filter
Automatically sort files into folders. 
For example, through the Python program, you can track the type of file that is in the “Downloads” folder, and then the application automatically moves the file to the music, photos, programs, and so on, depending on the type of file.

folder_track = specify full destination to DOWNLOADS folder (or another required for tracking folder).
folder_dest = specify full destination to FILTER folder (folder where sorted files should be saved).
